# ask gpt3

This is a simple program inspired by a tweet that I saw. It's a simple program that asks GPT-3 a question and then prints the answer.

## Usage

```bash
$ node ask.js "What is the meaning of life?"
```

Consider adding an alias to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file:

```bash
alias ask="node ~/path/to/ask.js"
```
